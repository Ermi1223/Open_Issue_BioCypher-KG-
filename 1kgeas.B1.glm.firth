### **3. Solving Cloning and Network Challenges Caused by Large File**
#### Steps:
1. **Move the File to External Storage**:
   - Upload the file to a cloud service like AWS S3:
     ```bash
     aws s3 cp 1kgeas.B1.glm.firth s3://your-bucket-name/
     ```

2. **Replace the File in the Repository**:
   - Delete the file and add a placeholder in the repository:
     ```bash
     git rm biocypher-kg/notebooks/1kgeas.B1.glm.firth
     echo "The file has been moved to: https://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/1kgeas.B1.glm.firth" > biocypher-kg/notebooks/README.md
     git add README.md
     git commit -m "Moved large file to external storage"
     ```

3. **Provide Download Instructions**:
   - Add instructions for users in the README:
     ```markdown
     ## Accessing Large Files
     The file `1kgeas.B1.glm.firth` is stored externally. Download it using:
     ```bash
     wget https://your-bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/1kgeas.B1.glm.firth
     ```

4. **Use Git LFS**:
   - If cloud storage isnâ€™t an option, use Git Large File Storage:
     ```bash
     git lfs track "*.glm.firth"
     git add .gitattributes
     git add biocypher-kg/notebooks/1kgeas.B1.glm.firth
     git commit -m "Track large file with Git LFS"
     ```
